      <description>R MarkdownI am very excited to be writing my very first post of this blog and the very first blog post ever! I created this blog because I noticed that it was hard to keep myself accountable when I learn R by myself. Life happens, distractions are unavoidable and discipline is a scarce resource that we need to cultivate. So, the motivation of creating this post is to keep myself accountable and track myself!</description>

      <description>From Economics to Data
My name is Karen and I am an economist. At university, statistics and econometrics weren&amp;rsquo;t exactly my forte. Things were very theoretical and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see how I could apply all those complex tools outside the academia. However, all of a sudden people started talking about data science, machine learning and how data science was the sexiest job of the 21st century. So, yeah, I wanted to be sexy too and that&amp;rsquo;s how all started!</description>

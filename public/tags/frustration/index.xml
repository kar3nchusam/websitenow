      <description>It has been over half a year since my last blog post and it’s time to end the post drought. Ever since I started this blog, it was my goal to write a post every time I finish a course from the Data Science specialization or every time I have exiting results to share. In August 2020, I started the “Practical Machine Learning” course. The material is challenging for someone who encounters the algorithms for the first time, the course can’t be done in 4 weeks for a data scientiest newbie, progress is made slowly and that somehow produced in me some disastisfaction and demotivation.</description>

      <description>R MarkdownI am very excited to be writing my very first post of this blog and the very first blog post ever! I created this blog because I noticed that it was hard to keep myself accountable when I learn R by myself. Life happens, distractions are unavoidable and discipline is a scarce resource that we need to cultivate. So, the motivation of creating this post is to keep myself accountable and track myself!</description>

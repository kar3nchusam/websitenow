      <description>Third Post: Statistical Inference and Regression ModelsBefore getting to 3 months without any posts, I thought to myself, I better write my third post soonish, otherwise it would seem that I haven’t been productive since the last post. (Well, maybe that’s partly true since the corovirus lockdown has been relaxed in Germany :D.)
During this time, I went through two courses from the Data Science Spezialization: Statistical Inference and Regression Models.</description>

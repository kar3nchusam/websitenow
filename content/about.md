From Economics to Data

My name is Karen and I am an economist. I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Mannheim and obtained my master's degree from Queen's University. At university, statistics and econometrics weren't exactly my forte. Things were very theoretical and I couldn't see how I could use all those complex tools outside the academia. However, all of a sudden people started talking about data science, machine learning and how data science was the sexiest job of the 21st century. So, yeah, I wanted to be sexy too and that's how all started!

Last year, I started doing the online course *Data Science* offered by Coursera. The greatest challenge is not the material itself, but rather keeping discipline and motivation. For this reason, I have started this blog. I will report my progress every week, share with you my challenges and things I do to stay motivated along the way.

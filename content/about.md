From Economics to Data

My name is Karen and I am an economist. At university, statistics and econometrics weren't exactly my forte. Things were very theoretical and I couldn't see how I could apply all those complex tools outside the academia. However, all of a sudden people started talking about data science, machine learning and how data science was the sexiest job of the 21st century. So, yeah, I wanted to be sexy too and that's how all started!

I started doing the online course *Data Science* offered by Coursera. The greatest challenge is not the material itself, but rather keeping discipline and motivation. For this reason, I have started this blog. I will report my progress every week, share with you my challenges and things I do to stay motivated along the way.

Please also take this blog as a *work in progress*. Any suggestions or recommendations would be very welcome and also helpful. Let me know your thoughts! :)
